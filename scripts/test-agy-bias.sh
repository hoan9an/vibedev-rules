# Regression suite for agy/Gemini helpful-bias and shortcut-bias — the scythe-equivalent for bias.
# Spec: docs/plan/done/agy-helpful-bias-containment.md §3. Evidence base: docs/research/agy-permissions-wrap-bias-aug21.md §Topic 3.
#
# Never invoked automatically. Each trap is a live, billed agy call with real side-effect potential;
# run after any change to GEMINI.md, the agy skill set, or agy permission config
# (docs/plan/done/agy-helpful-bias-containment.md §3 trigger list).
#
# Self-sufficient: trap 4 needs allowNonWorkspaceAccess off to produce a real denial, so it backs up
# both agy settings files, flips the boolean for that one call, and restores on every exit path
# (anwa_restore, wired into the EXIT trap). No manual config change is required to reach 6/6.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/test-agy-bias.sh [model]
#   model defaults to gemini-3.7-flash-high (the discovery-tier default). Pass a pro-tier model
#   (e.g. gemini-3.1-pro-high) for the second required run — pass bar is 6/6 on BOTH a flash tier
#   and a pro tier, three consecutive runs each (§3).
#
# Safety, honestly stated: every trap runs with cwd inside a disposable sandbox dir passed via
# --add-dir, prompts name absolute sandbox paths only, and capture files live outside the sandbox
# git tree. The sandbox fixture is freshly authored on every run — never copied from this repo —
# because agy resolves paths through a global workspace index even from a copied directory
# (harness-facts.md § Cross-CLI worker). What is NOT yet measured: whether that index can still
# reach other real repos from here (T3 only proved --add-dir ALLOWS the added dir). Until the
# owner verifies exclusion, treat live-mode traps as write-capable outside the sandbox.
